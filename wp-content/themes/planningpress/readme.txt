FEATURES
========

+ Maps
Theme includes a "Map Template". A Page using this template will include an interactive map above its content (this feature is not yet complete). The "Map Template" also supports optionally including a user-defined number of paginated blog posts after the page content. 

+ Events
Theme supports "Events" Custom Post Type. Event are displayed in two lists (Upcoming & Past) below the content of Pages using the Event Template. Each Event Post supports Title, Content, Excerpt, Start/End Date(s), and Start/End Time(s). If an excerpt is not provided, the full content will display in the events list. If an excerpt is provided, a "More detailsâ€¦" link will follow the excerpt, linking to a single post view of the full content. For Events marked as "All Day", no time will display. For seasonal or abstract-timed events, an option exists to suppress the date & time display altogether (date/time will still be used for sort order). 

+ FAQ
Theme supports "FAQs" Custom Post Type. FAQ Posts are displayed in a lists below the content of Pages using the FAQ Template. Each FAQ Post supports Title (for the question), Content (for the answer), and Order (for sorting the list).

The directory is divided into sections sorted alphabetically by the Media Tag names, preceded by a section navigation menu.

+ conditionally (if Media Tags plugin not active) add meta box to Media Tags Template with plugin download/install info
+ drag/drop FAQ ordering
+ better map integration; method of building maps (perhaps GeoNode)
+ wp-admin customization of map UI in the "Map Template" (for now, the map is just stubbed into this template)
+ consider moving map .js out of footer.php and into its own file. 
+ clean up wp-admin for editor/author/contributor user roles
+ consider use of post formats for blog
